# F24-Documents
For FSAI 2023-24, six documents must be submitted to IMechE: DCS, ASR, ASF, ADR, DSS, and SSR. The details for each are outlined in the FSAI official rule document.

Missing submission deadlines will result in significant point penalties, so it's crucial to regularly check the submission dates. These deadlines are listed under Key Dates and submissions are made via the Formula Student Account Portal under Documents & Resources.

Since information is spread across the Formula Student website, I recommend familiarising yourself with the interface to easily locate everything.
